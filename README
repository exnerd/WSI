WSI Project is my first Android project. The purpose is to retrieve your own comic collection (strips in het vloams)

At this moment I have no plans to open an account on the Google Market.
The advantage are not to known. The disadvantage are the price. So if you want to try this application, try it at
your risk by copying the .apk file (found in the bin directory) to your device and installing it.

Prerequisted : 
	* you need an account on stripinfo.be ;-)
	* your collection has to be public accessible ( see http://www.stripinfo.be/member_cp.php)
	
How to use : 
After installing the app, start the app, if all went well a screen with three tabs appears.
Hit the menu button. A menu-bar appears, hit 'Instellingen', fill in your accountname. Hit menu again, and sync.

Known issues:
	* large collection tend to take long to download.
	* Sync does not actually sync, but delete the local(Android) version of the collection and download the collection again.
	* after a succesfull download the tabs are not refreshed. Closing and reopening the app should help.
	* the only information accesible about your collection is 'Reeks' - 'Titel' - 'In bezit'
	
Further request :
	* download more information (cover, datum, ...)
	* download only the diff
	...
